                The border control between Djibouti and Ethiopia is carried out in two stages: the first 
                control is carried out by the border police, the second by customs. It is mandatory to pass 
                these two checkpoints, in the Djibouti / Ethiopia direction and vice versa. Failure to comply 
                with this rule exposes travelers to serious difficulties with the security services of the visited 
                country which may result in the immobilization of the vehicle and therefore the blocking of its owner 
                at the border for an indefinite period, without the embassy of France in Djibouti or the French Embassy 
                in Ethiopia cannot assist travelers who contravene this obligation or who are not able to present all the
                required documents.
                Presentation at the border on Friday (day of rest in Djibouti) or on a public holiday    
                involves the risk of not being able to enter Djibouti territory on the same day. It is therefore preferable
                and strongly recommended to obtain a visa in Addis Ababa or to show up at the border on a working day.                         
                Any foreigner must, if he stays in the Republic of Djibouti after the expiration of a    
                period of 3 months since his entry into the territory, be in possession of a temporary residence card or a 
                resident card issued under the conditions provided for by Law No. 201 / AN / 07 setting the conditions for entry
                and stay. The period of validity of the temporary residence card cannot exceed 1 year and cannot exceed the validity 
                of the travel documents. The foreigner must leave the Republic of Djibouti when the validity of his card expires, unless
                he obtains its renewal. The resident card is issued to foreigners employed in free zone companies who can prove that they
                are in possession of an employment contract and provide proof of the legality of their entry and stay in the territory of 
                the Republic of Djibouti.
